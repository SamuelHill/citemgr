The configuration is identified by the `conf` project\r\nproperty or by default uses `conf.gradle`.  To generate a TTL representation of\r\nall services conifgured in a given configuration file, you can use\r\n\r\n    gradle -Pconf=FILENAME ttl\r\n    \r\n\r\nOutput in `build/ttl` will include individual TTL files for each service, and a composite\r\nfile `all.ttl` with appropriate `@prefix` statements so it can be directly loaded into\r\nan RDF triple store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
